## Course Progression üìà

This course teaches MCP through hands-on implementation, progressing from basic chatbots to production-ready MCP ecosystems:

**Chatbot** ‚Üí **MCP Server** ‚Üí **MCP Client** ‚Üí **Multi-Server** ‚Üí **Full Features** ‚Üí **Remote Deployment**

## What You'll Build üõ†Ô∏è

### Research Paper MCP Server
- arXiv paper search with metadata storage  
- Tools, Resources, and Prompts for academic research
- Multi-transport support (stdio, SSE)

### Production MCP Ecosystem  
- Multi-server architecture with session management
- Integration with reference servers (filesystem, fetch)
- Remote deployment with Docker containerization
